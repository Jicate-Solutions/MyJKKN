-- THE REGRESSED BODY. This is the definition of fn_cdc_emit_drive_notification
-- that 20260915100000_cdc_drives_semester_targeting_circular_willingness.sql
-- left running - read from the live catalogue (pg_get_functiondef) on
-- 2026-09-18 - renamed so it can be installed beside the fixed version as a
-- CONTROL. Do not edit.
--
-- WHY IT IS KEPT, under a new name. 20260915100000 re-issued CREATE OR REPLACE
-- from an OLDER copy of the body and so silently dropped three things
-- 20260914210000 had added:
--   1. the attendance_day branch ENTIRELY - that transition notified nobody,
--   2. the learner URL '/cdc/drives/<id>/willingness' on learner-facing
--      branches - links went back to the coordinator page learners cannot open,
--   3. the cancelled team/learner split - one combined row again.
-- jicate/main fixed all three in
-- 20260919100000_cdc_drive_notification_emitter_restore.sql.
--
-- This file is therefore no longer "what main does" - that is
-- _fixtures/fn_cdc_emit_drive_notification.live-2026-09-22.sql. Its job now is
-- to prove the regression cases in drive-results-per-outcome.test.ts are NOT
-- vacuous: the same assertions that pass against the shipped function FAIL
-- against this body. It was named ...live-2026-09-18.sql until 2026-09-22.
