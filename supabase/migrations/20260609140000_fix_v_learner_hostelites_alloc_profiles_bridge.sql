-- Fix v_learner_hostelites: the allocation join was keyed on the wrong identity.
--
-- hostel_allocations.learner_id is an FK to profiles.id (the student's LOGIN
-- profile), NOT learners_profiles.id. The previous join
--     LEFT JOIN hostel_allocations ha ON ha.learner_id = lp.id
-- therefore NEVER matched any allocation row (profiles.id <> learners_profiles.id
-- for every learner). Result: current_block_id / current_room_id / current_bed_id /
-- current_allocation_id / current_block_name were ALWAYS NULL, so every hostelite
-- showed as "Unassigned" in the Residents list and the Block filter was inert —
-- even after a warden approved the allocation batch (status='active').
--
-- Bridge through profiles. profiles.learner_id = learners_profiles.id is strictly
-- 1:1 (verified: 4710 profiles, 4710 distinct learner_ids, 0 duplicates), so the
-- extra join introduces no row fan-out. Output column set is unchanged →
-- CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW (no DROP needed; dependent grants/policies preserved).
